# tropic-web

This is the frontend web application for the TROPIC Polymerization Thermodynamics Database, built with Next.js and Mantine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have **Node.js** (version 18 or later) installed on your system.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the development environment running.

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the `tropic-web` directory and install the required packages using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Run the Development Server

Start the local development server. This will launch the website with hot-reloading enabled.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Note that the TROPIC API also needs to be running for the website to work properly.

### 3. Build for Production

To create an optimized production build of the website, run the following command.

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the static files in the .out directory, ready for deployment.
